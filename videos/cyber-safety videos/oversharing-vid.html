		<br><h2>ANSWERS</h2>
			<p>
				1. No answer - discuss with classmates!<br><br><br>
				
				2. No, you shouldn’t! You don’t know them, so you don’t know if you can trust them.<br><br><br>
				
				3. Mitch emailed Taylor’s funny photo to many people without her permission<br>and embarrassed her. He also didn’t tell anyone about the caption,<br>which made it look like she peed herself in the photo,<br>when she actually just spilled water on her pants.<br><br><br>
				
				4. If you need help, talk to someone you trust.<br>Be careful of who you befriend online.<br>Be careful what you share on the Internet, because once it’s online,<br>it’s online forever.<br><br><br>
