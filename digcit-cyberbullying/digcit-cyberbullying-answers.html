		<h3><u>QUESTION #1</u>: Someone has been spreading false rumours online about Kenny. The rumours say that Kenny is a really awful person and no one should be friends with him! This makes Kenny feel really hurt and sad.</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Answer</b>: <i><u>YES</u></i> - this is cyberbullying!
			<br><br>
			<b>Explanation</b>: Whoever spread the rumours was saying things that aren't true, which shows that they are clearly trying to make Kenny feel bad. This can be called "a clear intent to harm someone" - they WANT to hurt someone - which is one of the biggest signs of cyberbullying.

		<h3><u>QUESTION #2</u>: Markus is on the basketball team. At practice, he kept missing the basket when he was shooting. When he got home, his friend texted him, ‚ÄúHey Mark, you had such nice shots today HAHA üòÇ‚Äù Markus just laughs and replies, ‚ÄúI know, right?‚Äù</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Answer</b>: <i><u>NO</u></i> - this is NOT cyberbullying!<br><br>
			<b>Explanation</b>: Markus‚Äô friend is just teasing him. There is no intention of hurting anyone, it‚Äôs just a joke that Markus understands and also laughed at.<br><br>

		<h3><u>QUESTION #3</u>: Marius always posts really bad photos of Jake on his WeChat Moments without asking for Jake‚Äôs permission. This upsets Jake, but Marius thinks Jake is just joking, and keeps posting the photos. Marius thinks the photos are really funny, and wants to share them with everyone for a laugh.</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Answer</b>: <i><u>YES</u></i> - this is cyberbullying!<br><br>
			<b>Explanation</b>: It may be unintentional - Marius didn't know that he was hurting Jake - but it still counts as cyberbullying. Marius kept posting the photos because HE thought it was funny, even when Jake said stop. When you repeatedly make someone feel bad even when they tell you to stop, digitally or in real life, it makes you a bully.<br><br>

		<h3><u>QUESTION #4</u>: Gina is in a group chat with a few other classmates. They always talk behind Hanna's back, one of their classmates. They pretend to be her friend, but on the group chat, they always say terrible things about her, they judge her and they criticise her, even though she didn‚Äôt do anything to them.</h3>
		
		<p>
			<b>Answer</b>: <i><u>YES</u></i> - this is cyberbullying!<br><br>
			<b>Explanation</b>: They're being extremely rude and mean by making fun of someone behind their backs. It's even worse because they pretend to be her friend. It's the same as bullying in real life, except it‚Äôs done through chatting on technology.<br><br>

		<h3><u>QUESTION #5</u>: Amy‚Äôs group of friends suggested a plan for the weekend - they would go to a theme park and ride all the crazy rollercoasters. But Amy‚Äôs scared of heights, so she didn‚Äôt want to. When Amy went home, Nala texted her, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be boring if you don‚Äôt go üò¢ It‚Äôs just a rollercoaster, don‚Äôt be such a wimp!‚Äù Amy felt hurt, because it felt like Nala was being insensitive and not caring about what Amy thinks.</h3>
			
		<p>
			<b>Answer</b>: <i><u>NO</u></i> - this is NOT cyberbullying!<br><br>
			<b>Explanation</b>: It wasn‚Äôt intentional in hurting Amy! Nala was just teasing her, trying to get some friendly banter, but she accidentally hurt Amy‚Äôs feelings. Sometimes, we accidentally say things that can hurt others, but as long as we apologise and learn from our mistakes, it‚Äôs okay.<br><br>

		<h2>
			It's <span class="never">NEVER</span> okay to bully someone, whether it's online or in real life.<br> Always be careful of the things you say or post, because they hold so much power to comfort or to hurt others. Remember, it's never wrong to ask for help. If you think someone is being cyberbullied, or if you are being cyberbullied, tell a trusted adult your situation, and let them help you.<br><br><br>
