		<h3>Question #1 - What type of free software may include spyware / malware?</h3>
		<p>
			(a) Electronic games<br><br>

		<h3>Question #2 - What is the optimal type and length of a computer password?</h3>
		<p>
			(a) Your name and birthday<br><br>
			(b) The word “password”<br><br>
			<b><mark>(c) 8 or more characters with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols</mark></b>	
			<br><br><br><br>
			
			<b><u>Explanation</u></b>: Always avoid common words or anything that can be easily guessed, because hackers use programs that let them try all kinds of words. Personal details such as birthdays should never be used as passwords, either.<br><br>
			<b>Make it more difficult for hackers by setting longer passwords with a mix of numbers, letters, and symbols.</b>		
		</p>
	</div>


	<div style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%">
		<br><br><br><br>
		<h3>Question #3 - You don’t know if your computer has anti-virus and anti-spyware to protect you. What should you do?</h3>
		<p>
			(a) Do nothing. It’s probably fine.<br><br>
			<b><mark>(b) Check your computer firewall and software to see if it’s working properly, then get new or updated security software from a store or a site that is trusted.</mark></b><br><br>
			(c) Get free anti-virus software from the pop-up ad that you keep seeing.
			<br><br><br><br>
			
			<b><u>Explanation</u></b>: Hackers take advantage of unprotected computers, so your personal information or any transactions can be seen by others.<br><br>
			<b>You should always make sure that your computer is protected.</b>
		</p>
	</div>


	<div style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%">
		<br><br><br><br>
		<h3>Question #4 - Before entering personal information online, you should find out:</h3>
		<p>
			(a) How the company collecting your information will protect it<br><br>
			(b) Why the company needs this information<br><br>
			(c) With whom this information might be shared<br><br>
			<b><mark>(d) All of the above </mark></b>
			<br><br><br><br>
			
			<b><u>Explanation</u></b>: All of these are important. You want to learn as much as you can about how your information will be shared, why it’s needed, and whether it will be shared with other companies.<br><br>
			<b>Always protect your personal information!</b>
		</p>
	</div>


	<div style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%">
		<br><br><br><br>
		<h3>Question #5 - Someone you met online asked you for personal information, such as your full name, your birthday, where you live, where you go to school, etc. What should you do?</h3>
		<p>
			<b><mark>(a) Don't give away my personal information</mark></b><br><br>
			(b) I'll tell them all of that except where I live<br><br>
			(c) They seem nice, so it's okay to tell them<br><br><br><br>
			
			<b><u>Explanation</u></b>: Always protect your personal information! It's dangerous to tell a stranger such things - even if you don't tell them where you live, if you've given them enough information, they can find that out themselves. Remember, you don't actually know who is behind the other screen.<br><br>
			<b>Stay safe online, and don't answer such personal questions.</b>
		</p>
	</div>


	<div style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%">
		<br><br><br><br>
		<h3>Question #6 : You get an email from a game company asking to sign up for free games - they ask for your account information and other personal information. What should you do?</h3>
		<p>
			(a) Click the link to the email to check the website first before providing any information<br><br>
			<b><mark>(b) First delete the email. If you think the email is real, ask your parents to call the company’s customer service and ask about it</mark></b><br><br>
			(c) Reply the email with your information like they asked
			<br><br><br><br>
			
			<b><u>Explanation</u></b>: Someone is trying to "phish" for information - trying to trick you into giving them your personal information. Just clicking the link in this kind of email can install spyware / malware onto your computer.<br><br>
			<b>Always stay aware.</b>
